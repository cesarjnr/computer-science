Commands

set

The set command sets a variable. We need to pass the variable name and its value:

  set(SOME_VARIABLE SOME_VALUE)

include

The include command loads and run CMake code from a file or module. We need to pass the file or module name:

  include(SOME_MODULE)
  include(./somefile)

A module is simply a .cmake file located in the folder CMakeFiles generated by CMake. For example, libraries that requires CMake to generate its build files are considered modules.
