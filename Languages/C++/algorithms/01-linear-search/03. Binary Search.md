### 1. Definitions

**Binary search** is an algorithm where we repeatedly look at the middle element in the array, and determine whether the element we're looking for must be to the left, or to the right. Each time we do this, we're able to halve the number of elements we still need to search, making binary search a lot faster than linear search.

### 2. Usage

We use it when the array is sorted.
If we only need to perform a single search, then it's faster to just do a linear search, as it takes longer to sort than to linear search. If we're going to be performing a lot of searches, it is often worth sorting the data first so we can use binary search for the repeated searches.

### 3. Complexity

The time complexity for a binary search is O(log n) since at each iteration we divide the length of the array (n) by 2.
