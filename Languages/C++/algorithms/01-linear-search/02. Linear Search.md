### 1. Definitions

The **linear search** algorithm compares each element in the array until it finds the element that is being searched.

### 2. Usage

We use it when the array is not sorted and therefore we cannot use the binary search algorithm.

### 3. Complexity

In the worst case, a linear search ends up checking the entire array. Therefore, the time complexity for a linear search is O(n).

### 4. Code

```cpp
  // Declare an integer array of 5 elements
  int arr[5] = {3,1,2,5,4};

  // Make the linear search by checking each element, starting from the first one
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (arr[i] == elementBeingSearched) {
      return arr[i];
    }
  }
```
