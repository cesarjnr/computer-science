# Authentication

Django comes with a built-in authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions.

## Installation

The necessary settings are already included in the `settings.py` file generated by the `django-admin start project` command, which are the following:

```python
# root/project/settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
  #...,
  'django.contrib.auth',
  'django.contrib.contenttypes'
]

MIDDLEWARE = [
  #...,
  'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
  'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware'
]
```

With this settings in place, running the command `manage.py migrate` creates the necessary database tables for auth related models and permissions for any models defined in our installed apps.

## Login

The following is a simple login route config:

```python
# root/app/urls.py

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
  path('login', views.login_user, name='login')
]

# root/app/views.py

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login

def login_user(request):

```

> We cannot set the route handler name to `login` because it will conflict with the `login` function we are importing from Django when referencing it in the `urls.py` file.
