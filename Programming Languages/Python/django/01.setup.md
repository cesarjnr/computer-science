# Setup

1. Initialize the environment:
```sh
    python3 -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate the environment:
```sh
    source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install Django:
```sh
    pip install Django
```

4. Generate the dependencies file:
```sh
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

5. Set up the project folder:
```sh
    django-admin startproject project-name [directory-name]
```

> By default, Django will create a directory with the name being `project-name` and if you don't specify the `directory-name` it will create another directory within `project-name` with the same name as the `project-name`. If you don't to create another directory within `project-name` you can use the dot (`.`) as the `directory-name`:
>
> ```
> django-admin startproject project-name .
> ```
>
> Django will create all files inside `project-name` directly.

6. Set up an app:
```sh
    python manage.py startapp app-name
```

7. Run the server:
```sh
    python manage.py runserver
```
