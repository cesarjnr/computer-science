# Database

After setting up your database, you'll need to create a superuser for your Django project by using the `createsuperuser` command:

```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

You'll be prompted to set a name, an email and a password. You can leave the email blank if you want.

## Admin Interface

Django provides an admin interface by reading metadata from your models to provide a quick, model-centric interface where trusted users can manage content on your site.
This admin interface is enabled in the default project template used by `startproject`.
You can access it by visiting the URL **/admin** and logging in using your super user credentials.
